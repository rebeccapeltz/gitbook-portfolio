# Rebecca (Becky) Peltz

I love learning and sharing what I know with others. I mentored developers and taught adults who wanted to learn web development and programming. I learned a lot from their questions and perspectives. &#x20;

I learn by attending classes and webinars. I teach myself by reading, writing, and drawing pictures.&#x20;
