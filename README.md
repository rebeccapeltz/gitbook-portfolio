I love learning, and I aim for mastery. I like sharing what I know with others.  I mentored Junior developers and learned a lot from their questions and perspectives. As a software developer, I've spent many years teaching computers what to do, and along the way, I found opportunities to teach people. &#x20;

I teach myself by reading, writing, and drawing pictures.&#x20;
