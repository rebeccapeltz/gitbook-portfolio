### Description

This book introduces the students to project-based learning by offering a four-week course on creating websites using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  The course uses replit.com, an online development environment.

### Tools/Technology

This book was written and hosted using the online GitBook editor. This supports a four-week course that introduces students to web development and programming.  The course teaches students how to code in HTML, JavaScript, and CSS.  It also introduces them to working in the cloud because it uses an online IDE to create the code and GitHub to store and serve the web pages that students make.
