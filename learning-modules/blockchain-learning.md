[Blockchain Learning](https://www.beckypeltz.me/blockchain-learning/)

I used docusaurus to create a [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/) book that explains the origin and basic principles of blockchains.  I also created an exercise using a blockchain wallet to retrieve and store test cryptocurrency.

My goal was to keep the content short and to the point so that the reader could quickly grasp some of blockchain technology's basic functionality and features. &#x20;

Docusaurus renders a web book similar to Gitbook, and I was interested in seeing the difference between the two tools.  This book is deployed to GitHub.
