### Description

Cloudinary transformations are used to transform media.  They can be applied to images, video, and audio. Some transformations can apply to all media types, and some are specific to the media.  Many transformations are available and documented, but it can be challenging to remember them all and to understand them as collections with similar intentions.  Many transformations apply an "effect," which is easily seen in the period table.  They are the pale blue-green making up the center of the table.&#x20;

The periodic table organized chemicals by atomic structure and weight, representing a natural ordering based on shared properties. The Cloudinary periodic table represents the ordering of the Cloudinary transformation API. Creating order and structure precedes creating knowledge.

The application is clickable, and clicking on an "element" within it should take you to its documentation.

### Tools/Technology
