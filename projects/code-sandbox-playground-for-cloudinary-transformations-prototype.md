### Description

While working at Cloudinary as a Curriculum Program Manager, I created a prototype for a playground using a React library called [sandpack-react](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@codesandbox/sandpack-react).  This library is hosted by [codesandbox.io](https://codesandbox.io/).  The intention was to provide sample code that the user could modify and try out the creation of  Cloudinary transformations on images, video, and audio.

### Technology

This front-end application was created with the React framework using the Cloudinary React SDK.
